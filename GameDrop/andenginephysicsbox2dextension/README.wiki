=== AndEngine tribute ===
[[https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEnginePhysicsBox2DExtension/tree/GLES2-AnchorCenter/|AndEnginePhysic]](anchor-center) 
extension repository fork, as the main repository seems to be out of support.
Checkout [[https://github.com/nicolasgramlich/AndEnginePhysicsBox2DExtension/blob/GLES2/README.md|original readme]]
file to get more information.

The same steps I did for the AndEngine repo which you can find [[https://bitbucket.org/yaroslav_havrylovych/andengine|here]].

=== PROGUARD ===
When you're configuring proguard in you app you have to set all restrictions in your app proguard rules
(as proguard works for the whole application but not for the separate project). Particularly AndEngine Physics Extension
will force you to add next lines to your app proguard rules:

{{{
-keep public class com.badlogic.gdx.physics.box2d.World {                                                                         
  *;                                                                                                                              
}
}}}
